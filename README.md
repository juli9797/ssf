# ssf ( S U P E R     S I M P L E     F I L E explorer xD)
Terminal based file explorer (not quite a manager)

## Specs
* C++ (CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY)
* **File Search Funktion** (like dmenu but for files)
* 2 or 3 Folder Layers (?)
* use .xresources
* VIM KEYBINDINGS (at least a few)! (hjkl - direction, dd - delete, y - yank, p - paste, / - search)
* visual and normal mode 
* :<command> - evaluate commands/shortcuts
* o - open (xdg-open)

FUTURE:
* Image preview (sounds hard to implement)
